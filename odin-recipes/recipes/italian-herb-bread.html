        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>

    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Gather all ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mix warm water, sugar, and yeast together in a large bowl; let sit 
        until mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir 3 cups flour, Romano cheese, olive oil, salt, basil, oregano, garlic 
        powder, and onion powder into yeast mixture. Gradually mix in remaining 3 
        cups flour until incorporated; dough will be stiff.
    </li>
    <li>
        Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and rubbery, 5 to 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place dough into an oiled bowl and turn until the surface is coated. Cover with a 
        damp dish towel and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
        Punch dough down to release air; shape into two loaves. Place each loaf into a greased 
        9x5-inch loaf pan. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove loaves from the pans and let cool 
        on wire racks for at least 15 minutes before slicing.
    </li>
